    "month": "Jun",
    "abstract": "Plants are extremely plastic organisms. They continuously receive and integrate environmental information and adjust their growth and development to favor fitness and survival. When this integration of information affects subsequent life stages or the development of subsequent generations, it can be considered an environmental memory. Thus, plant memory is a relevant mechanism by which plants respond adaptively to different environments. If the cost of maintaining the response is offset by its benefits, it may influence evolutionary trajectories. As such, plant memory has a sophisticated underlying molecular mechanism with multiple components and layers. Nonetheless, when mathematical modelling is combined with the knowledge of ecological, physiological, and developmental effects as well as the molecular mechanisms as a tool for understanding plant memory, the combined potential becomes unfathomable for the management of plant communities in natural and agricultural ecosystems. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of plant memory, discuss the ecological requirements for its evolution, outline the multilayered molecular network and mechanisms required for accurate and fail-proof plant responses to variable environments, point out the direct involvement of the plant metabolism and discuss the tremendous potential of various types of models to further our understanding of the plant's environmental memory. Throughout, we emphasize the use of plant memory as a tool to unlock the secrets of the natural world.",

    "month": "Feb",
    "abstract": "Since emerging in Brazil in 1985, wheat blast has spread throughout South America and recently appeared in Bangladesh and Zambia. Here we show that two wheat resistance genes, *Rwt3* and *Rwt4*, acting as host-specificity barriers against non-*Triticum* blast pathotypes encode a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat immune receptor and a tandem kinase, respectively. Molecular isolation of these genes will enable study of the molecular interaction between pathogen effector and host resistance genes.",

    "year": "2022",
    "month": "Oct",
    "abstract": "Most resistance genes thus far isolated from wheat have a very limited number of functional alleles, with the exception of the powdery mildew *PM3* resistance locus. Here we report the isolation of most of the alleles at wheat stem rust resistance gene locus *SR9*, representing the largest multi-allelic rust resistance locus in common wheat. The seven previously reported resistance alleles (*Sr9a, Sr9b, Sr9d, Sr9e, Sr9f, Sr9g,* and *Sr9h*) at the locus were characterised using a synergistic strategy. Loss-of-function mutants and/or transgenic complementation were used to confirm *Sr9b*, two haplotypes of *Sr9e* (*Sr9e_h1*, *Sr9e_h2*), *Sr9g*, and *Sr9h*. Each allele encodes a highly related nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) type immune receptor, containing a previously unreported motif at their N termini and an unusual long LRR domain, that confers resistance to a unique spectrum of isolates of the wheat stem rust pathogen. The only SR9 protein effective against stem rust pathogen race TTKSK (Ug99), SR9H, differed from SR9B by a single amino acid. SR9B and SR9G resistance proteins were also distinguished by only a single amino acid. The *SR9* allelic series found in the B subgenome are orthologs of wheat stem rust resistance gene *Sr21* located in the A subgenome with around 85% identity in protein sequences.",

    "year": "2022",
    "month": "Jul",
    "abstract": "Quantitative gene regulation at the cell population-level can be achieved by two fundamentally different modes of regulation at individual gene copies. A “digital” mode involves binary ON/OFF expression states, with population-level variation arising from the proportion of gene copies in each state, while an “analog” mode involves graded expression levels at each gene copy. At the Arabidopsis floral repressor *FLOWERING LOCUS C* (*FLC*), “digital” Polycomb silencing is known to facilitate quantitative epigenetic memory in response to cold. However, whether *FLC* regulation before cold involves analog or digital modes is unknown. Using quantitative fluorescent imaging of *FLC* mRNA and protein, together with mathematical modelling, we find that *FLC* expression before cold is regulated by both analog and digital modes. We observe a temporal separation between the two modes, with analog preceding digital. The analog mode can maintain intermediate expression levels at individual *FLC* gene copies, before subsequent digital silencing, consistent with the copies switching OFF stochastically and heritably without cold. This switch leads to a slow reduction in *FLC* expression at the cell population-level. These data present a new paradigm for gradual repression, elucidating how analog transcriptional and digital epigenetic memory pathways can be integrated.",

    "year": "2021", 
    "month": "Jun",
    "abstract": "Plants monitor many aspects of their fluctuating environments to help align their development with seasons. Molecular understanding of how noisy temperature cues are registered has emerged from dissection of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which involves a multiphase cold-dependent silencing of the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Cold-induced transcriptional silencing precedes a low probability PRC2 epigenetic switching mechanism. The epigenetic switch requires the absence of warm temperatures as well as long-term cold exposure. However, the natural temperature inputs into the earlier transcriptional silencing phase are less well understood. Here, through investigation of Arabidopsis accessions in natural and climatically distinct field sites, we show that the first seasonal frost strongly induces expression of COOLAIR, the antisense transcripts at FLC. Chamber experiments delivering a constant mean temperature with different fluctuations showed the freezing induction of COOLAIR correlates with stronger repression of FLC mRNA. Identification of a mutant that ectopically activates COOLAIR revealed how COOLAIR up-regulation can directly reduce FLC expression. Consistent with this, transgenes designed to knockout COOLAIR perturbed the early phase of FLC silencing. However, all transgenes designed to remove COOLAIR resulted in increased production of novel convergent FLC antisense transcripts. Our study reveals how natural temperature fluctuations promote COOLAIR regulation of FLC, with the first autumn frost acting as a key indicator of autumn/winter arrival.",

    "abstract": "Temperature intrinsically influences all aspects of biochemical and biophysical \r\nprocesses. Organisms have therefore evolved strategies to buffer themselves against \r\nthermal perturbations. Many organisms also use temperature signals as cues to align \r\nbehavior and development with certain seasons. These developmentally important \r\nthermosensory mechanisms have generally been studied in constant temperature \r\nconditions. However, environmental temperature is an inherently noisy signal, and it \r\nhas been unclear how organisms reliably extract specific temperature cues from \r\nfluctuating temperature profiles. In this context, we discuss plant thermosensory \r\nresponses, focusing on temperature sensing throughout vernalization in Arabidopsis. \r\nWe highlight many different timescales of sensing, which has led to the proposal of \r\na distributed thermosensing paradigm. Within this paradigm, we suggest a \r\nclassification system for thermosensors.

    "year": "2020",
    "month": "Oct",
    "abstract": "Plants have adapted to tolerate and survive constantly changing environmental conditions by \r\nreprogramming gene expression in response to stress or to drive developmental transitions. Among the many \r\nsignals that plants perceive, light and temperature are of particular interest due to their intensely \r\nfluctuating nature which is combined with a long-term seasonal trend. Whereas specific receptors are key \r\nin the light-sensing mechanism, the identity of plant thermosensors for high and low temperatures remains \r\nfar from fully addressed. This review aims at discussing common as well as divergent characteristics of \r\ngene expression regulation in plants, controlled by light and temperature. Light and temperature signaling \r\ncontrol the abundance of specific transcription factors, as well as the dynamics of co-transcriptional \r\nprocesses such as RNA polymerase elongation rate and alternative splicing patterns. Additionally, sensing \r\nboth types of cues modulates gene expression by altering the chromatin landscape and through the induction \r\nof long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, while light sensing is channeled through dedicated receptors, \r\ntemperature can broadly affect chemical reactions inside plant cells. Thus, direct thermal modifications of \r\nthe transcriptional machinery add another level of complexity to plant transcriptional regulation. Besides \r\nthe rapid transcriptome changes that follow perception of environmental signals, plant developmental transitions \r\nand acquisition of stress tolerance depend on long-term maintenance of transcriptional states (active or \r\nsilenced genes). Thus, the rapid transcriptional response to the signal (Phase I) can be distinguished from \r\nthe long-term memory of the acquired transcriptional state (Phase II – remembering the signal). In this review \r\nwe discuss recent advances in light and temperature signal perception, integration and memory in Arabidopsis \r\nthaliana, focusing on transcriptional regulation and highlighting the contrasting and unique features of each \r\ntype of cue in the process.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is a key factor in the growth and development of all organisms. Plants have to \r\ninterpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development \r\nwith the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses, but the mechanisms that \r\nintegrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of *VERNALIZATION \r\nINSENSITIVE 3* (*VIN3*), a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically \r\nsilence *FLOWERING LOCUS C* (*FLC*) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression. \r\nHere, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that \r\nconstitutively activate *VIN3* expression and alter the slow *VIN3* cold induction profile. In the wild type, \r\nthe NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates *VIN3* transcription. Through \r\ncombining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this \r\nslow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent \r\ngrowth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for \r\n*VIN3* upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct \r\nthermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.",

    "month": "Jan",
    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana, the cold-induced epigenetic regulation of *FLOWERING LOCUS C* (*FLC*) \r\ninvolves distinct phases of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) silencing. During cold, a PHD–PRC2 complex \r\nmetastably and digitally nucleates H3K27me3 within *FLC*. On return to warm, PHD–PRC2 spreads across the \r\nlocus delivering H3K27me3 to maintain long-term silencing. Here, we studied natural variation in this \r\nprocess in Arabidopsis accessions, exploring Lov-1, which shows *FLC* reactivation on return to warm, a \r\nfeature characteristic of *FLC* in perennial Brassicaceae. This analysis identifies an additional phase \r\nin this Polycomb silencing mechanism downstream from H3K27me3 spreading. In this long-term silencing \r\n(perpetuated) phase, the PHD proteins are lost from the nucleation region and silencing is likely \r\nmaintained by the read-write feedbacks associated with H3K27me3. A combination of noncoding SNPs in the \r\nnucleation region mediates instability in this long-term silencing phase with the result that Lov-1 *FLC* \r\nfrequently digitally reactivates in individual cells, with a probability that diminishes with increasing \r\ncold duration. We propose that this decrease in reactivation probability is due to reduced DNA replication \r\nafter flowering. Overall, this work defines an additional phase in the Polycomb mechanism instrumental in \r\nnatural variation of silencing, and provides avenues to dissect broader evolutionary changes at *FLC*.",

    "abstract": "Plants integrate widely fluctuating temperatures to monitor seasonal progression. Here, we \r\ninvestigate the temperature signals in field conditions that result in vernalisation, the mechanism by \r\nwhich flowering is aligned with spring. We find that multiple, distinct aspects of the temperature profile \r\ncontribute to vernalisation. In autumn, transient cold temperatures promote transcriptional shutdown of \r\nArabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (*FLC*), independently of factors conferring epigenetic memory. As winter \r\ncontinues, expression of *VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3* (*VIN3*), a factor needed for epigenetic silencing, is \r\nupregulated by at least two independent thermosensory processes. One integrates long-term cold temperatures, \r\nwhile the other requires the absence of daily temperatures above 15°C. The lack of spikes of high \r\ntemperature, not just prolonged cold, is thus the major driver for vernalisation. Monitoring of peak daily \r\ntemperature is an effective mechanism to judge seasonal progression, but is likely to have deleterious \r\nconsequences for vernalisation as the climate becomes more variable.",

    "abstract": "Cold temperature is an environmental signal that can quantitatively determine the \r\nexpression levels of the plant flowering regulator, Flowering Locus C (*FLC*), weeks or months \r\nafter the cold signal itself has gone, a classic example of quantitative epigenetics. A close \r\ncollaboration between mathematical modelers and biologists has significantly elucidated the mechanisms \r\nbehind this long-term quantitative epigenetic regulation. This work has demonstrated that cold memory \r\nis held independently at each *FLC* gene copy in an all-or-nothing digital fashion. This memory is likely \r\nstored, at least in part, by high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a silencing \r\nhistone modification. The fraction of digitally ON versus OFF loci gives the graded *FLC* levels observed \r\nat a population level. Modeling has also predicted the need for antagonism between activating and \r\nsilencing histone modifications, a feature which has recently been confirmed experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO₂ into valuable hydrocarbons using TiO₂ is a promising route \r\nfor mitigating the effects of global warming and meeting future energy demands. However, TiO₂ utilises UV \r\nlight for photocatalysis and its hydrocarbon yields are still low. In order to enhance the light absorption \r\nand increase yields, light-harvesting complexes (LHCII) extracted from spinach were attached to the surface \r\nof Rh-doped TiO₂ (TiO₂:Rh) resulting in a hybrid catalyst, TiO₂:Rh-LHCII. The LHCII can absorb visible light \r\nin green plants, which convert CO₂ to sugars via photosynthesis. CO, acetaldehyde and methyl formate \r\nwere produced from aqueous CO₂ solution in a stirred batch reactor under visible-light irradiation. \r\nThe yields of acetaldehyde and methyl formate were enhanced by almost ten and four times respectively, when \r\nusing TiO₂:Rh-LHCII compared to those of TiO₂:Rh.",

    "year": "2013",
    "month": "Mar",
    "abstract": "The optical properties of plant surfaces are strongly determined by the shape of epidermal \r\ncells and by the patterning of the cuticle on top of the cells. Combinations of particular cell shapes with \r\nparticular nanoscale structures can generate a wide range of optical effects. Perhaps most notably, the \r\ndevelopment of ordered ridges of cuticle on top of flat petal cells can produce diffraction-grating-like \r\nstructures. A diffraction grating is one of a number of mechanisms known to produce ‘structural colours’, \r\nwhich are more intense and pure than chemical colours and can appear iridescent. We explore the concept that \r\nmechanical buckling of the cuticle on the petal epidermis might explain the formation of cuticular ridges, \r\nusing a theoretical model that accounts for the development of compressive stresses in the cuticle arising \r\nfrom competition between anisotropic expansion of epidermal cells and isotropic cuticle production. Model \r\npredictions rationalize cuticle patterns, including those with long-range order having the potential to \r\ngenerate iridescence, for a range of different flower species.",
