The temperature sensing mechanism of this process is still poorly understood, with the prevailing idea being that one or a few specialised “thermosensors” collect the temperature information. I worked on an interdisciplinary project and developed a mathematical model that helped elucidate this mechanism, showing that multiple, distinct temperature inputs are necessary and implicated growth as a thermosensor. Together with collaborators (JIC, Lund and Sundsvall), I designed and carried out experiments that showed that plants sense the “absence of warmth” as the signature of winter. Our mathematical model had predictive power and I used it to predict the plant’s response in a climate warming scenario.",
