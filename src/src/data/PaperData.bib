  title = "Manipulation of photosensory and circadian signalling restricts phenotypic plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions in Arabidopsis",
  year = {2024},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {Plants exploit phenotypic plasticity to adapt their growth and development to prevailing environmental conditions. Interpretation of light and temperature signals is aided by the circadian system, which provides a temporal context. Phenotypic plasticity provides a selective and competitive advantage in nature but is obstructive during large-scale, intensive agricultural practices since economically important traits (including vegetative growth and flowering time) can vary widely depending on local environmental conditions. This prevents accurate prediction of harvesting times and produces a variable crop. In this study, we sought to restrict phenotypic plasticity and circadian regulation by manipulating signaling systems that govern plants’ responses to environmental signals. Mathematical modeling of plant growth and development predicted reduced plant responses to changing environments when circadian and light signaling pathways were manipulated. We tested this prediction by utilizing a constitutively active allele of the plant photoreceptor phytochrome B, along with disruption of the circadian system via mutation of {EARLY FLOWERING3}. We found that these manipulations produced plants that are less responsive to light and temperature cues and thus fail to anticipate dawn. These engineered plants have uniform vegetative growth and flowering time, demonstrating how phenotypic plasticity can be limited while maintaining plant productivity. This has significant implications for future agriculture in both open fields and controlled environments.},

  abstract = {Quantitative gene regulation at the cell population level can be achieved by two fundamentally different modes of regulation at individual gene copies. A ‘digital’ mode involves binary ON/OFF expression states, with population-level variation arising from the proportion of gene copies in each state, while an ‘analog’ mode involves graded expression levels at each gene copy. At the {Arabidopsis} floral repressor {FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)}, ‘digital’ Polycomb silencing is known to facilitate quantitative epigenetic memory in response to cold. However, whether {FLC} regulation before cold involves analog or digital modes is unknown. Using quantitative fluorescent imaging of {FLC} mRNA and protein, together with mathematical modeling, we find that {FLC} expression before cold is regulated by both analog and digital modes. We observe a temporal separation between the two modes, with analog preceding digital. The analog mode can maintain intermediate expression levels at individual {FLC} gene copies, before subsequent digital silencing, consistent with the copies switching OFF stochastically and heritably without cold. This switch leads to a slow reduction in {FLC} expression at the cell population level. These data present a new paradigm for gradual repression, elucidating how analog transcriptional and digital epigenetic memory pathways can be integrated.},

  title = "Plant Environmental Memory: Implications, Mechanisms, And Opportunities For Plant Scientists And Beyond",
  year = {2023},
  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {Plants are extremely plastic organisms. They continuously receive and integrate environmental information and adjust their growth and development to favour fitness and survival. When this integration of information affects subsequent life stages or the development of subsequent generations, it can be considered an environmental memory. Thus, plant memory is a relevant mechanism by which plants respond adaptively to different environments. If the cost of maintaining the response is offset by its benefits, it may influence evolutionary trajectories. As such, plant memory has a sophisticated underlying molecular mechanism with multiple components and layers. Nonetheless, when mathematical modelling is combined with knowledge of ecological, physiological, and developmental effects as well as molecular mechanisms as a tool for understanding plant memory, the combined potential becomes unfathomable for the management of plant communities in natural and agricultural ecosystems. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of plant memory, discuss the ecological requirements for its evolution, outline the multilayered molecular network and mechanisms required for accurate and fail-proof plant responses to variable environments, point out the direct involvement of the plant metabolism and discuss the tremendous potential of various types of models to further our understanding of the plant’s environmental memory. Throughout, we emphasize the use of plant memory as a tool to unlock the secrets of the natural world.},

  doi = {10.1101/gad.348362.121}, 
  abstract ={Plants monitor many aspects of their fluctuating environments to help align their development with seasons. Molecular understanding of how noisy temperature cues are registered has emerged from dissection of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which involves a multiphase cold-dependent silencing of the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Cold-induced transcriptional silencing precedes a low probability PRC2 epigenetic switching mechanism. The epigenetic switch requires the absence of warm temperatures as well as long-term cold exposure. However, the natural temperature inputs into the earlier transcriptional silencing phase are less well understood. Here, through investigation of Arabidopsis accessions in natural and climatically distinct field sites, we show that the first seasonal frost strongly induces expression of COOLAIR, the antisense transcripts at FLC. Chamber experiments delivering a constant mean temperature with different fluctuations showed the freezing induction of COOLAIR correlates with stronger repression of FLC mRNA. Identification of a mutant that ectopically activates COOLAIR revealed how COOLAIR up-regulation can directly reduce {FLC} expression. Consistent with this, transgenes designed to knockout {COOLAIR} perturbed the early phase of FLC silencing. However, all transgenes designed to remove {COOLAIR} resulted in increased production of novel convergent {FLC} antisense transcripts. Our study reveals how natural temperature fluctuations promote {COOLAIR} regulation of {FLC}, with the first autumn frost acting as a key indicator of autumn/winter arrival.},

We highlight many different timescales of sensing, which has led to the proposal of 
a distributed thermosensing paradigm. Within this paradigm, we suggest a

  abstract = {Plants have adapted to tolerate and survive constantly changing environmental conditions by 
reprogramming gene expression in response to stress or to drive developmental transitions. Among the many 
signals that plants perceive, light and temperature are of particular interest due to their intensely 
fluctuating nature which is combined with a long-term seasonal trend. Whereas specific receptors are key 
in the light-sensing mechanism, the identity of plant thermosensors for high and low temperatures remains 
far from fully addressed. This review aims at discussing common as well as divergent characteristics of 
gene expression regulation in plants, controlled by light and temperature. Light and temperature signaling 
control the abundance of specific transcription factors, as well as the dynamics of co-transcriptional 
processes such as RNA polymerase elongation rate and alternative splicing patterns. Additionally, sensing 
both types of cues modulates gene expression by altering the chromatin landscape and through the induction 
of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, while light sensing is channeled through dedicated receptors, 
temperature can broadly affect chemical reactions inside plant cells. Thus, direct thermal modifications of 
the transcriptional machinery add another level of complexity to plant transcriptional regulation. Besides 
the rapid transcriptome changes that follow perception of environmental signals, plant developmental transitions 
and acquisition of stress tolerance depend on long-term maintenance of transcriptional states (active or 
silenced genes). Thus, the rapid transcriptional response to the signal (Phase I) can be distinguished from 
the long-term memory of the acquired transcriptional state (Phase II – remembering the signal). In this review 
we discuss recent advances in light and temperature signal perception, integration and memory in {Arabidopsis 
thaliana}, focusing on transcriptional regulation and highlighting the contrasting and unique features of each 
type of cue in the process.}

silence {FLOWERING LOCUS C} ({FLC}) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression. 
Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that 
constitutively activate {VIN3} expression and alter the slow {VIN3} cold induction profile. In the wild type, 
the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates {VIN3} transcription. Through 
combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this 
slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent 
growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for 
{VIN3} upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct 
thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.}

involves distinct phases of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) silencing. During cold, a PHD–PRC2 complex 
metastably and digitally nucleates H3K27me3 within {FLC}. On return to warm, PHD–PRC2 spreads across the 
locus delivering H3K27me3 to maintain long-term silencing. Here, we studied natural variation in this 
process in Arabidopsis accessions, exploring Lov-1, which shows {FLC} reactivation on return to warm, a 
feature characteristic of {FLC} in perennial {Brassicaceae}. This analysis identifies an additional phase 
in this Polycomb silencing mechanism downstream from H3K27me3 spreading. In this long-term silencing 
(perpetuated) phase, the PHD proteins are lost from the nucleation region and silencing is likely 
maintained by the read-write feedbacks associated with H3K27me3. A combination of noncoding SNPs in the 
nucleation region mediates instability in this long-term silencing phase with the result that Lov-1 {FLC} 
frequently digitally reactivates in individual cells, with a probability that diminishes with increasing 
cold duration. We propose that this decrease in reactivation probability is due to reduced DNA replication 
after flowering. Overall, this work defines an additional phase in the Polycomb mechanism instrumental in 
natural variation of silencing, and provides avenues to dissect broader evolutionary changes at {FLC}.}

making. Here, we dissect how Arabidopsis plants integrate widely fluctuating field temperatures over month-long 
timescales to progressively upregulate {VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3} ({VIN3}) and silence {FLOWERING LOCUS C} 
({FLC}), aligning flowering with spring. We develop a mathematical model for vernalization that operates on 
multiple timescales -- long term (month), short term (day), and current (hour) -- and is constrained by experimental 
data. Our analysis demonstrates that temperature sensing is not localized to specific nodes within the {FLC} 
network. Instead, temperature sensing is broadly distributed, with each thermosensory process responding to 
specific features of the plants' history of exposure to warm and cold. The model accurately predicts {FLC} 
silencing in new field data, allowing us to forecast FLC expression in changing climates. We suggest that distributed 
thermosensing may be a general property of thermoresponsive regulatory networks in complex natural environments.}

	abstract = {Plants integrate widely fluctuating temperatures to monitor seasonal progression. Here, we 
investigate the temperature signals in field conditions that result in vernalisation, the mechanism by 
which flowering is aligned with spring. We find that multiple, distinct aspects of the temperature profile 
contribute to vernalisation. In autumn, transient cold temperatures promote transcriptional shutdown of 
Arabidopsis {FLOWERING LOCUS C} ({FLC}), independently of factors conferring epigenetic memory. As winter 
continues, expression of {VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3} ({VIN3}), a factor needed for epigenetic silencing, is 
upregulated by at least two independent thermosensory processes. One integrates long-term cold temperatures, 
while the other requires the absence of daily temperatures above 15°C. The lack of spikes of high 
temperature, not just prolonged cold, is thus the major driver for vernalisation. Monitoring of peak daily 
temperature is an effective mechanism to judge seasonal progression, but is likely to have deleterious 
consequences for vernalisation as the climate becomes more variable.}

expression levels of the plant flowering regulator, {Flowering Locus C} ({FLC}), weeks or months 
after the cold signal itself has gone, a classic example of quantitative epigenetics. A close 
collaboration between mathematical modelers and biologists has significantly elucidated the mechanisms 
behind this long-term quantitative epigenetic regulation. This work has demonstrated that cold memory 
is held independently at each {FLC} gene copy in an all-or-nothing digital fashion. This memory is likely 
stored, at least in part, by high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a silencing 
histone modification. The fraction of digitally ON versus OFF loci gives the graded {FLC} levels observed 
at a population level. Modeling has also predicted the need for antagonism between activating and 
silencing histone modifications, a feature which has recently been confirmed experimentally.}

light for photocatalysis and its hydrocarbon yields are still low. In order to enhance the light absorption 
and increase yields, light-harvesting complexes (LHCII) extracted from spinach were attached to the surface 
of Rh-doped {TiO$_2$} ({TiO$_2$:Rh}) resulting in a hybrid catalyst, {TiO$_2$:Rh-LHCII}. The LHCII can absorb visible light 
in green plants, which convert {CO$_2$} to sugars via photosynthesis. CO, acetaldehyde and methyl formate 
were produced from aqueous {CO$_2$} solution in a stirred batch reactor under visible-light irradiation. 
The yields of acetaldehyde and methyl formate were enhanced by almost ten and four times respectively, when 
using {TiO$_2$:Rh-LHCII} compared to those of {TiO$_2$:Rh}.}

  abstract = {The optical properties of plant surfaces are strongly determined by the shape of epidermal 
cells and by the patterning of the cuticle on top of the cells. Combinations of particular cell shapes with 
particular nanoscale structures can generate a wide range of optical effects. Perhaps most notably, the 
development of ordered ridges of cuticle on top of flat petal cells can produce diffraction-grating-like 
structures. A diffraction grating is one of a number of mechanisms known to produce ‘structural colours’, 
which are more intense and pure than chemical colours and can appear iridescent. We explore the concept that 
mechanical buckling of the cuticle on the petal epidermis might explain the formation of cuticular ridges, 
using a theoretical model that accounts for the development of compressive stresses in the cuticle arising 
from competition between anisotropic expansion of epidermal cells and isotropic cuticle production. Model 
predictions rationalize cuticle patterns, including those with long-range order having the potential to 
generate iridescence, for a range of different flower species.}
