  abstract ={Plants monitor many aspects of their fluctuating environments to help align their development with seasons. Molecular understanding of how noisy temperature cues are registered has emerged from dissection of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which involves a multiphase cold-dependent silencing of the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Cold-induced transcriptional silencing precedes a low probability PRC2 epigenetic switching mechanism. The epigenetic switch requires the absence of warm temperatures as well as long-term cold exposure. However, the natural temperature inputs into the earlier transcriptional silencing phase are less well understood. Here, through investigation of Arabidopsis accessions in natural and climatically distinct field sites, we show that the first seasonal frost strongly induces expression of COOLAIR, the antisense transcripts at FLC. Chamber experiments delivering a constant mean temperature with different fluctuations showed the freezing induction of COOLAIR correlates with stronger repression of FLC mRNA. Identification of a mutant that ectopically activates COOLAIR revealed how COOLAIR up-regulation can directly reduce FLC expression. Consistent with this, transgenes designed to knockout COOLAIR perturbed the early phase of FLC silencing. However, all transgenes designed to remove COOLAIR resulted in increased production of novel convergent FLC antisense transcripts. Our study reveals how natural temperature fluctuations promote COOLAIR regulation of FLC, with the first autumn frost acting as a key indicator of autumn/winter arrival.},

processes. Organisms have therefore evolved strategies to buffer themselves against 
thermal perturbations. Many organisms also use temperature signals as cues to align 
behavior and development with certain seasons. These developmentally important 
thermosensory mechanisms have generally been studied in constant temperature 
conditions. However, environmental temperature is an inherently noisy signal, and it 
has been unclear how organisms reliably extract specific temperature cues from 
fluctuating temperature profiles. In this context, we discuss plant thermosensory 
responses, focusing on temperature sensing throughout vernalization in Arabidopsis. 
We highlight many different timescales of sensing, which has led to the proposal of 
a distributed thermosensing paradigm. Within this paradigm, we suggest a 
classification system for thermosensors. Finally, we focus on the longest timescale, 
which is most important for sensing winter, and examine the different mechanisms in 
which memory of cold exposure can be achieved.}

  abstract = {Plants have adapted to tolerate and survive constantly changing environmental conditions by 
reprogramming gene expression in response to stress or to drive developmental transitions. Among the many 
signals that plants perceive, light and temperature are of particular interest due to their intensely 
fluctuating nature which is combined with a long-term seasonal trend. Whereas specific receptors are key 
in the light-sensing mechanism, the identity of plant thermosensors for high and low temperatures remains 
far from fully addressed. This review aims at discussing common as well as divergent characteristics of 
gene expression regulation in plants, controlled by light and temperature. Light and temperature signaling 
control the abundance of specific transcription factors, as well as the dynamics of co-transcriptional 
processes such as RNA polymerase elongation rate and alternative splicing patterns. Additionally, sensing 
both types of cues modulates gene expression by altering the chromatin landscape and through the induction 
of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, while light sensing is channeled through dedicated receptors, 
temperature can broadly affect chemical reactions inside plant cells. Thus, direct thermal modifications of 
the transcriptional machinery add another level of complexity to plant transcriptional regulation. Besides 
the rapid transcriptome changes that follow perception of environmental signals, plant developmental transitions 
and acquisition of stress tolerance depend on long-term maintenance of transcriptional states (active or 
silenced genes). Thus, the rapid transcriptional response to the signal (Phase I) can be distinguished from 
the long-term memory of the acquired transcriptional state (Phase II – remembering the signal). In this review 
we discuss recent advances in light and temperature signal perception, integration and memory in {Arabidopsis 
thaliana}, focusing on transcriptional regulation and highlighting the contrasting and unique features of each 
type of cue in the process.}

  abstract = {Temperature is a key factor in the growth and development of all organisms. Plants have to 
interpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development 
with the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses, but the mechanisms that 
integrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of {VERNALIZATION 
INSENSITIVE 3} ({VIN3}), a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically 
silence {FLOWERING LOCUS C} ({FLC}) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression. 
Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that 
constitutively activate {VIN3} expression and alter the slow {VIN3} cold induction profile. In the wild type, 
the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates {VIN3} transcription. Through 
combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this 
slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent 
growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for 
{VIN3} upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct 
thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.}

  abstract = {In {Arabidopsis thaliana}, the cold-induced epigenetic regulation of {FLOWERING LOCUS C} ({FLC}) 
involves distinct phases of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) silencing. During cold, a PHD–PRC2 complex 
metastably and digitally nucleates H3K27me3 within {FLC}. On return to warm, PHD–PRC2 spreads across the 
locus delivering H3K27me3 to maintain long-term silencing. Here, we studied natural variation in this 
process in Arabidopsis accessions, exploring Lov-1, which shows {FLC} reactivation on return to warm, a 
feature characteristic of {FLC} in perennial {Brassicaceae}. This analysis identifies an additional phase 
in this Polycomb silencing mechanism downstream from H3K27me3 spreading. In this long-term silencing 
(perpetuated) phase, the PHD proteins are lost from the nucleation region and silencing is likely 
maintained by the read-write feedbacks associated with H3K27me3. A combination of noncoding SNPs in the 
nucleation region mediates instability in this long-term silencing phase with the result that Lov-1 {FLC} 
frequently digitally reactivates in individual cells, with a probability that diminishes with increasing 
cold duration. We propose that this decrease in reactivation probability is due to reduced DNA replication 
after flowering. Overall, this work defines an additional phase in the Polycomb mechanism instrumental in 
natural variation of silencing, and provides avenues to dissect broader evolutionary changes at {FLC}.}

specific features of the plants' history of exposure to warm and cold. The model accurately predicts {FLC}

upregulated by at least two independent thermosensory processes. One integrates long-term cold temperatures, 
while the other requires the absence of daily temperatures above 15°C. The lack of spikes of high 
temperature, not just prolonged cold, is thus the major driver for vernalisation. Monitoring of peak daily 
temperature is an effective mechanism to judge seasonal progression, but is likely to have deleterious 
consequences for vernalisation as the climate becomes more variable.}

stored, at least in part, by high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a silencing 
histone modification. The fraction of digitally ON versus OFF loci gives the graded {FLC} levels observed 
at a population level. Modeling has also predicted the need for antagonism between activating and
