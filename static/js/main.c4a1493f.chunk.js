They continuously receive and integrate environmental information and adjust their growth and development to favor fitness and survival. When this integration of information affects subsequent life stages or the development of subsequent generations, it can be considered an environmental memory. Thus, plant memory is a relevant mechanism by which plants respond adaptively to different environments. If the cost of maintaining the response is offset by its benefits, it may influence evolutionary trajectories. As such, plant memory has a sophisticated underlying molecular mechanism with multiple components and layers. Nonetheless, when mathematical modelling is combined with the knowledge of ecological, physiological, and developmental effects as well as the molecular mechanisms as a tool for understanding plant memory, the combined potential becomes unfathomable for the management of plant communities in natural and agricultural ecosystems. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of plant memory, discuss the ecological requirements for its evolution, outline the multilayered molecular network and mechanisms required for accurate and fail-proof plant responses to variable environments, point out the direct involvement of the plant metabolism and discuss the tremendous potential of various types of models to further our understanding of the plant\'s environmental memory. Throughout, we emphasize the use of plant memory as a tool to unlock the secrets of the natural world.","journal":"AoB PLANTS","pages":"plad032","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plad032","authors":["Gabriela Auge","Valentin Hankofer","Martin Groth","Rea L.

The seven previously reported resistance alleles (*Sr9a, Sr9b, Sr9d, Sr9e, Sr9f, Sr9g,* and *Sr9h*) at the locus were characterised using a synergistic strategy.

Each allele encodes a highly related nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) type immune receptor, containing a previously unreported motif at their N termini and an unusual long LRR domain, that confers resistance to a unique spectrum of isolates of the wheat stem rust pathogen. The only SR9 protein effective against stem rust pathogen race TTKSK (Ug99), SR9H, differed from SR9B by a single amino acid. SR9B and SR9G resistance proteins were also distinguished by only a single amino acid.

Using quantitative fluorescent imaging of *FLC* mRNA and protein, together with mathematical modelling, we find that *FLC* expression before cold is regulated by both analog and digital modes. We observe a temporal separation between the two modes, with analog preceding digital. The analog mode can maintain intermediate expression levels at individual *FLC* gene copies, before subsequent digital silencing, consistent with the copies switching OFF stochastically and heritably without cold.

Molecular understanding of how noisy temperature cues are registered has emerged from dissection of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which involves a multiphase cold-dependent silencing of the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Cold-induced transcriptional silencing precedes a low probability PRC2 epigenetic switching mechanism. The epigenetic switch requires the absence of warm temperatures as well as long-term cold exposure. However, the natural temperature inputs into the earlier transcriptional silencing phase are less well understood. Here, through investigation of Arabidopsis accessions in natural and climatically distinct field sites, we show that the first seasonal frost strongly induces expression of COOLAIR, the antisense transcripts at FLC. Chamber experiments delivering a constant mean temperature with different fluctuations showed the freezing induction of COOLAIR correlates with stronger repression of FLC mRNA. Identification of a mutant that ectopically activates COOLAIR revealed how COOLAIR up-regulation can directly reduce FLC expression. Consistent with this, transgenes designed to knockout COOLAIR perturbed the early phase of FLC silencing. However, all transgenes designed to remove COOLAIR resulted in increased production of novel convergent FLC antisense transcripts. Our study reveals how natural temperature fluctuations promote COOLAIR regulation of FLC, with the first autumn frost acting as a key indicator of autumn/winter arrival.","journal":"Genes & Development","volume":"35","pages":"888-898","url":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/early/2021/05/13/gad.348362.121.abstract","authors":["Yusheng Zhao\\\\*","Pan Zhu\\\\*","Jo Hepworth","Rebecca H.

Our mathematical model had predictive power and I used it to predict the plant\u2019s response in a climate warming scenario.",supervisors:"In the groups of [Prof Martin Howard](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/martin-howard/) and [Prof Dame Caroline Dean](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/caroline-dean/)",contributors:["Jo Hepworth","Yusheng Zhao","Julia I Q\xfcesta","Rebecca H Bloomer","Am\xe9lie Heckmann","Torbj\xf6rn S\xe4ll (Lund University)","Svante Holm (Mid Sweden University)","Caroline Dean","Martin Howard"],keywords:["Journal-Article"],image:"images/arabid_field.jpg",videoImage:"images/video_image.jpg",videoLink:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1Tr2A8jlc",logo:"images/jic.jpg",link:"https://www.jic.ac.uk/",collaboratorLogo1:"images/midSwedenUni.png",collaboratorLogo2:"images/lund.png",funderLogo:"images/ERC.png",sortKey:2018}]},oe={postdoc:function(e){return"**".concat(e.year,"**  \n    ").concat(e.area,"  \n    ").concat(e.location)},phd:function(e){return"**".concat(e.year,"**  \n    ").concat(e.area,"  \n    ").concat(e.location)}},re={postdoc:function(e){return r.a.createElement("div",null,e.collaboratorLogo1?r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.collaboratorLink1}," ",r.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Media",style:{marginRight:"15px"},className:"rounded float-right",width:"200px",src:e.collaboratorLogo1})," "):"",e.collaboratorLogo2?r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.collaboratorLink2}," ",r.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Media",style:{marginRight:"15px"},className:"rounded float-right",width:"200px",src:e.collaboratorLogo2})," "):"",r.a.createElement(m.a,null,"".concat(e.supervisors,"  ")),e.contributors?r.a.createElement(m.a,null,"**Collaborators:** ".concat(e.contributors.join(", "),"  ")):"",r.a.createElement(m.a,null,"".concat(e.abstract)),e.funderLogo?r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.funderLink}," ",r.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Media",style:{marginRight:"15px"},className:"rounded float-right",width:"200px",src:e.funderLogo})," "):"",e.videoImage?r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.videoLink}," ",r.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Media",style:{marginRight:"15px"},className:"rounded float-left",width:"250px",src:e.videoImage})," "):"")},phd:function(e){return r.a.createElement("div",null,r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.collaboratorLink1}," ",r.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Media",style:{marginRight:"15px"},className:"rounded float-right",width:"200px",src:e.collaboratorLogo1})," "),e.collaboratorLogo2?r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.collaboratorLink2}," ",r.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Media",style:{marginRight:"15px"},className:"rounded float-right",width:"200px",src:e.collaboratorLogo2})," "):"",r.a.createElement(m.a,null,"  **Title: ".concat(e.thesisTitle,"**  \n        **Supervisors:** ").concat(e.supervisors.join(", "))),r.a.createElement(m.a,null,"**Collaborators:** ".concat(e.collaborators.join(", "))),r.a.createElement(m.a,null,"".concat(e.abstract)))}},ie={blue:E.vlightBlue,yellow:E.vlightYellow},se={blue:E.darkBlue,yellow:E.darkYellow};var le=function(e){var t,n={backgroundColor:"".concat(ie[e.selectColor]),border:"1px solid ".concat(se[e.selectColor]),marginBottom:"10px"};return r.a.createElement(J.a,null,r.a.createElement(h.a,{style:n},r.a.createElement(J.a.Toggle,{as:h.a.Header,eventKey:"0"},r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.entry.link}," ",r.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Media",style:{marginRight:"15px"},className:"rounded float-right",width:"200px",src:e.entry.logo})," "),r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.entry.imageLink}," ",r.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Media",style:{marginRight:"15px"},className:"rounded float-left",width:"200px",src:e.entry.image})," "),r.a.createElement(h.a,{style:{border:"transparent",background:"transparent",minWidth:"250px"}},r.a.createElement(m.a,null,(t=e.entry,"".concat(t.title,"  \n------")))),r.a.createElement(m.a,null,oe[e.entry.type](e.entry)),"More \u02c5"),r.a.createElement(J.a.Collapse,{eventKey:"0"},r.a.createElement(h.a.Body,null,re[e.entry.type](e.entry)))))};var ce=function(e){var t=new ae;return r.a.createElement("div",{style:e.sectionStyle,id:"workExperience"},r.a.createElement(c.a,null,r.a.createElement(S,{title:"Research Experience",selectColor:e.titleColour}),function(){var n=t.getKeys();return r.a.createElement("div",null,y.a.map(n,(function(n,a){return r.a.createElement(le,{key:a,selectColor:e.themeColour,entry:t.getEntry(n)})})))}()))},ue=function e(){var t=this;Object(f.a)(this,e),this.getEntry=function(e){return y.a.find(t.data,(function(t){return t.key===e}))},this.extractKey=function(e){return y.a.map(e,(function(e){return e.key}))},this.getKeys=function(){return t.extractKey(t.data)},this.data=[{key:"phd",type:"phd",year:"2009-14",title:"PhD in Biosciences",location:"University of Nottingham, UK",topic:"Artificial Photosynthesis",area:"Interdisciplinary research combining Biology, Mathematics and Chemical Engineering",thesisTitle:"LHCII-assisted TiO2 photocatalysis of CO2 to small organic compounds.",supervisors:["Prof. E.
