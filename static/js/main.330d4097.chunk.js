Plants have to \\r\\ninterpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development \\r\\nwith the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses, but the mechanisms that \\r\\nintegrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of VERNALIZATION \\r\\nINSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3), a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically \\r\\nsilence FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression. \\r\\nHere, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that \\r\\nconstitutively activate VIN3 expression and alter the slow VIN3 cold induction profile. In the wild type, \\r\\nthe NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates VIN3 transcription. Through \\r\\ncombining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this \\r\\nslow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent \\r\\ngrowth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for \\r\\nVIN3 upregulation.
