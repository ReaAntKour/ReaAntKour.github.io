  abstract = {Temperature intrinsically influences all aspects of biochemical and biophysical 
processes. Organisms have therefore evolved strategies to buffer themselves against 
thermal perturbations. Many organisms also use temperature signals as cues to align 
behavior and development with certain seasons. These developmentally important 
thermosensory mechanisms have generally been studied in constant temperature 
conditions. However, environmental temperature is an inherently noisy signal, and it 
has been unclear how organisms reliably extract specific temperature cues from 
fluctuating temperature profiles. In this context, we discuss plant thermosensory 
responses, focusing on temperature sensing throughout vernalization in Arabidopsis. 
We highlight many different timescales of sensing, which has led to the proposal of 
a distributed thermosensing paradigm. Within this paradigm, we suggest a 
classification system for thermosensors. Finally, we focus on the longest timescale, 
which is most important for sensing winter, and examine the different mechanisms in 
which memory of cold exposure can be achieved.}

  abstract = {Plants have adapted to tolerate and survive constantly changing environmental conditions by 
reprogramming gene expression in response to stress or to drive developmental transitions. Among the many 
signals that plants perceive, light and temperature are of particular interest due to their intensely 
fluctuating nature which is combined with a long-term seasonal trend. Whereas specific receptors are key 
in the light-sensing mechanism, the identity of plant thermosensors for high and low temperatures remains 
far from fully addressed. This review aims at discussing common as well as divergent characteristics of 
gene expression regulation in plants, controlled by light and temperature. Light and temperature signaling 
control the abundance of specific transcription factors, as well as the dynamics of co-transcriptional 
processes such as RNA polymerase elongation rate and alternative splicing patterns. Additionally, sensing 
both types of cues modulates gene expression by altering the chromatin landscape and through the induction 
of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, while light sensing is channeled through dedicated receptors, 
temperature can broadly affect chemical reactions inside plant cells. Thus, direct thermal modifications of 
the transcriptional machinery add another level of complexity to plant transcriptional regulation. Besides 
the rapid transcriptome changes that follow perception of environmental signals, plant developmental transitions 
and acquisition of stress tolerance depend on long-term maintenance of transcriptional states (active or 
silenced genes). Thus, the rapid transcriptional response to the signal (Phase I) can be distinguished from 
the long-term memory of the acquired transcriptional state (Phase II â€“ remembering the signal). In this review 
we discuss recent advances in light and temperature signal perception, integration and memory in {Arabidopsis 
thaliana}, focusing on transcriptional regulation and highlighting the contrasting and unique features of each 
type of cue in the process.}
